# Git Feature Chain Whitepaper

## Abstract
<!-- The abstract is the first impression of your white paper. It should succinctly summarize the project’s goals, technology, and potential impact. A compelling abstract encourages readers to delve deeper. -->

## Introduction
<!-- Introduce the project with a clear and concise overview. Establish the problem the project aims to solve and provide a brief glimpse into the proposed solution. -->
As of today Git is the de-facto Source Version Control (SVC) system for source code.
It had found great success among software developers for it's speed, simplicity for the average user and fully distributed nature.
Git has proven useful in corporate development, where a clear hierarchy can be astablished, or in Free and Open Source (FOSS) projects where a core team or an indevidual, a Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL) manages the project.

But it's often that a FOSS project is abandoned by it's core team or BDFL, as there is no financial incentive for the continued support of the project. Development is usually supported through donations, which are few and far between, so FOSS projects are usally not a viable option for a full-time development careers.

When the project may die if it lacks traction, but otherwise it will usually be forked by several teams, and eventually one or two of the new forks will gain some of the traction of the original project.
unfortunately most users are likely to not notice the change and will get stuck with the unmaintained old version until it is not viable anymore, and eventually discard it.
Indeed, it is often the case that FOSS projects die by constant forking and shifts in project maintenance.

The goal of this project is to introduce what we see as the next step of evolution for Git, stepping into the new era of Web3. By introducing Blockchain technology into the source control mechanism we aspire to completely dicentralize Git from any one BDFL or core team, and give the code back to the people, thus eliminating project fragmentation through consistent forking and maintainer changes - A code base under Git Feature Chain will always be under maintanence of the development collective.

Our new crypto coin called `FeatureToken` will create a financial incentive for continued support of FOSS projects, and enable new careers in fully open-source development, liberating developers from corporate control. Developers will aquire `FeatureToken`s from adding features to programs, fixing bugs, performing code review, or any activity on the code voted by the community via a smart contract.

Although simple from the outside, behind the porcelain exterior fo Git hides it's ingenious piping.
Beneath the user facing layer, Git's core technology is the Merkle Tree, the same as core technology as Blockchain.
To modify Git's Merkle Tree to a Blockchain a proof mechanism has to be developed.
Git Feature Chain implements a "Proof of Stake" system, TBD
